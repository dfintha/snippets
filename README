Personal Snippet "Library"
==========================

This repository contains numerous code snippets, with variable usability. These
are just hastily realized ideas, written in different programming languages.

Snippet files always contain a header, explaining the idea behind it, and may
contain an interface section denoting the part that would be found in a header
file, an implementation section, where the functionality itself is written, and
a demonstration section, with a main function and other helper functions to try
it out.

The repository does not contain a makefile. Most of the snippets found here
can be copied to the Compiler Explorer (https://godbolt.org/) directly to
try them out (there are some that require external libraries, some that are not
written in C/C++, and some that aren't code snippets but
commands/configurations).

Under no circumstances should any of these snippets be used in a professional
environment without thorough testing beforehand.
