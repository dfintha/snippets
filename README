Personal Snippet Library
========================

This repository contains numerous code snippets, with variable usability. These
are just hastily realized ideas, written in various programming languages.

Snippet files may contain a header, explaining the idea behind it, an interface
section, which denotes the part that would be found in a header file, an
implementation section, where the functionality itself is written, and a
demonstration section, with a main function and other helper functions to try it
out.

The repository does not contain a makefile. Most of the source codes found here
can be copied to the Compiler Explorer (https://godbolt.org/) by itself, and
should work (there are some that require external libraries, some that are in
different languages, and some that aren't code but rather instructions).

Under no circumstances should any of these snippets be used in a professional
environment without thorough testing.
